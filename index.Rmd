## Honoring his memory {style="text-align: center"}

Daniel J. Smyczek, University School of Milwaukee class of 2010, passed away tragically in August 2022 at the age of 30. Dan was an avid teacher, a loyal friend, and a curious explorer. Dan was particularly passionate about technologies that push the boundaries of science. After college, Dan took the initiative to learn as much as he could about biotechnology, ultimately helping to develop commercial applications for gene-delivery technologies similar to those used in the COVID-19 vaccines. Still curious and eager to share his knowledge with others, Dan would start each of his meetings with an update on the development of the James Webb telescope. Had he lived, Dan would have continued to promote scientific research and educate his colleagues, friends, and many loving nieces and nephews.


## Helping the next generation {style="text-align: center"}

Whether it be on the hockey rink or in front of clients in the conference room, Dan’s successes were driven by passion for his work. In this spirit, Dan’s friends and family are starting a fund to support an annual symposium at USM which will recruit thought leaders in the fields of science and technology to share their passions with USM students through annual "TED Talk" style presentations. Our initial goal is to raise an endowment of $100,000 to fund speaker recruitment and event organization. Additional funds beyond this level will allow us to recruit more broadly and expose students to world-class speakers. 

## How to help {style="text-align: center"}

The best way to help us is to use the "contribute" link on this page to donate directly to University School of Milwaukee. Specify "The Dan Smyczek Fund" as the gift designation or mark "other" and specify that the gift is to be made in honor of Dan Smyczek. Alternatively, use the GoFundMe link to donate (note that GoFundMe will receive a small percentage of these donations). All donations collected will be placed in an endowment to be managed by USM to fund the symposium. Thank you for your support.
